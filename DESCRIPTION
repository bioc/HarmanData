        optimisation based technique. Contains three datasets: IMR90,
        Human lung fibroblast cells exposed to nitric oxide; NPM, an
        experiment to test skin penetration of metal oxide
        nanoparticles following topical application of sunscreens in
        non-pregnant mice; OLF; an experiment to gauge the response of
        human olfactory neurosphere-derived (hONS) cells to ZnO
        nanoparticles.

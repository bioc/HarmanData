Description: Datasets of accompany Harman, a PCA and constrained
        optimisation based technique. Contains three example datasets:
        IMR90, Human lung fibroblast cells exposed to nitric oxide;
        NPM, an experiment to test skin penetration of metal oxide
        nanoparticles following topical application of sunscreens in
        non-pregnant mice; OLF; an experiment to gauge the response of
        human olfactory neurosphere-derived (hONS) cells to ZnO
        nanoparticles.
        Since version 1.24, this package also contains the Infinium5
        dataset, a set of batch correction adjustments across 5 Illumina
        Infinium Methylation BeadChip datasets. This file does not
        contain methylation data, but summary statistics of 5 datasets
        after correction.
        There is also an EpiSCOPE_sample file as exampling for the new
        methylation clustering functionality in Harman.
